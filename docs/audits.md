# Audit Rules

This page documents each of the audits currently implemented in `zizmor`.

See each audit's section for its scope, behavior, and other information.

Legend:

| Type     | Examples         | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| The kind of audit ("Workflow" or "Action") | Links to vulnerable examples | Added to `zizmor` in this version | The audit works with `--offline` | The audit needs to be explicitly enabled with `--pedantic` |

## `artipacked`

| Type     | Examples         | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [artipacked.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[artipacked.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/artipacked.yml

Detects local filesystem `git` credential storage on GitHub Actions, as well as
potential avenues for unintentional persistence of credentials in artifacts.

By default, using @actions/checkout causes a credential to be persisted
in the checked-out repo's `.git/config`, so that subsequent `git` operations
can be authenticated.

Subsequent steps may accidentally publicly persist `.git/config`, e.g. by
including it in a publicly accessible artifact via @actions/upload-artifact.

However, even without this, persisting the credential in the `.git/config`
is non-ideal unless actually needed.

Other resources:

* [ArtiPACKED: Hacking Giants Through a Race Condition in GitHub Actions Artifacts]

### Remediation

Unless needed for `git` operations, @actions/checkout should be used with
`#!yaml persist-credentials: false`.

If the persisted credential is needed, it should be made explicit
with `#!yaml persist-credentials: true`.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml title="artipacked.yml" hl_lines="7"
    on: push

    jobs:
      artipacked:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml title="artipacked.yml" hl_lines="7-9"
    on: push

    jobs:
      artipacked:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            with:
              persist-credentials: false
    ```

## `dangerous-triggers`

| Type     | Examples                  | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [pull-request-target.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[pull-request-target.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/pull-request-target.yml

Detects fundamentally dangerous GitHub Actions workflow triggers.

Many of GitHub's workflow triggers are difficult to use securely.
This audit checks for some of the biggest offenders:

* `pull_request_target`
* `workflow_run`

These triggers are dangerous because they run in the context of the
*target repository* rather than the *fork repository*, while also being
typically triggerable by the latter. This can lead to attacker controlled
code execution or unexpected action runs with context controlled by a malicious
fork.

Other resources:

* [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 1: Preventing pwn requests]
* [Vulnerable GitHub Actions Workflows Part 1: Privilege Escalation Inside Your CI/CD Pipeline]

### Remediation

The use of dangerous triggers can be difficult to remediate, since they don't
always have an immediate replacement.

Replacing a dangerous trigger with a safer one (or keeping the dangerous
trigger, but eliminating the risk of code execution) requires case-by-case
consideration.

Some general pointers:

* Replace `workflow_run` triggers with `workflow_call`: this will require
  re-tooling the workflow to be a [reusable workflow].
* Replace `pull_request_target` with `pull_request`, unless you *absolutely*
  need repository write permissions (e.g. to leave a comment or make
  other changes to the upstream repo).
* Never run PR-controlled code in the context of a
  `pull_request_target`-triggered workflow.
* Avoid attacker-controllable flows into `GITHUB_ENV` in both `workflow_run`
  and `pull_request_target` workflows, since these can lead to arbitrary
  code execution.

[reusable workflow]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows

## `excessive-permissions`

| Type     | Examples                    | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [excessive-permissions.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[excessive-permissions.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/excessive-permissions.yml

Detects excessive permissions in workflows, both at the workflow level and
individual job levels.

Users frequently over-scope their workflow and job permissions,
or set broad workflow-level permissions without realizing that
all jobs inherit those permissions.

### Remediation

In general, permissions should be declared as minimally as possible, and
as close to their usage site as possible.

In practice, this means that workflows should almost always set
`#!yaml permissions: {}` at the workflow level to disable all permissions
by default, and then set specific job-level permissions as needed.

For example:

=== "Before"

    ```yaml title="excessive-permissions.yml" hl_lines="8-9"
    on:
      release:
        types:
          - published

    name: release

    permissions:
      id-token: write # trusted publishing + attestations

    jobs:
      build:
        name: Build distributions üì¶
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - # omitted for brevity

      publish:
        name: Publish Python üêç distributions üì¶ to PyPI
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: [build]

        steps:
          - name: Download distributions
            uses: actions/download-artifact@fa0a91b85d4f404e444e00e005971372dc801d16 # v4
            with:
              name: distributions
              path: dist/

          - name: publish
            uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml title="excessive-permissions.yml" hl_lines="8 21-22"
    on:
      release:
        types:
          - published

    name: release

    permissions: {}

    jobs:
      build:
        name: Build distributions üì¶
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - # omitted for brevity

      publish:
        name: Publish Python üêç distributions üì¶ to PyPI
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: [build]
        permissions:
          id-token: write # trusted publishing + attestations

        steps:
          - name: Download distributions
            uses: actions/download-artifact@fa0a91b85d4f404e444e00e005971372dc801d16 # v4
            with:
              name: distributions
              path: dist/

          - name: publish
            uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
    ```

## `hardcoded-container-credentials`

| Type     | Examples                    | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [hardcoded-credentials.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[hardcoded-credentials.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/hardcoded-credentials.yml

Detects Docker credentials (usernames and passwords) hardcoded in various places
within workflows.

### Remediation

Use [encrypted secrets] instead of hardcoded credentials.

[encrypted secrets]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions

=== "Before"

    ```yaml title="hardcoded-container-credentials.yml" hl_lines="11 17"
    on:
      push:

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        container:
          image: fake.example.com/example
          credentials:
            username: user
            password: hackme
        services:
          service-1:
            image: fake.example.com/anotherexample
            credentials:
              username: user
              password: hackme
        steps:
          - run: echo 'hello!'
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml title="hardcoded-container-credentials.yml" hl_lines="11 17"
    on:
      push:

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        container:
          image: fake.example.com/example
          credentials:
            username: user
            password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        services:
          service-1:
            image: fake.example.com/anotherexample
            credentials:
              username: user
              password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} # (1)!
        steps:
          - run: echo 'hello!'
    ```

    1. This may or may not be the same credential as above, depending on your configuration.


## `impostor-commit`

| Type     | Examples              | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [impostor-commit.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ                 |

[impostor-commit.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/impostor-commit.yml

Detects commits within a repository action's network that are not present on
the repository itself, also known as "impostor" commits.

GitHub represents a repository and its forks as a "network" of commits.
This results in ambiguity about where a commit comes from: a commit
that exists only in a fork can be referenced via its parent's
`owner/repo` slug, and vice versa.

GitHub's network-of-forks design can be used to obscure a commit's true origin
in a fully-pinned `uses:` workflow reference. This can be used by an attacker
to surreptitiously introduce a backdoored action into a victim's workflows(s).

A notable historical example of this is github/dmca@565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5,
which appears to be on @github/dmca is but really on a fork (with an impersonated
commit author).

Other resources:

* [What the fork? Imposter commits in GitHub Actions and CI/CD]

### Remediation

Impostor commits are **visually indistinguishable** from normal best-practice
hash-pinned actions.

Always **carefully review** external PRs that add or change
hash-pinned actions by consulting the claimant repository and confirming that
the commit actually exists within it.

The only remediation, once discovered, is to replace the impostor commit
within an authentic commit (or an authentic tag/branch reference).

## `known-vulnerable-actions`

| Type     | Examples                       | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [known-vulnerable-actions.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ                 |

[known-vulnerable-actions.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/known-vulnerable-actions.yml

Detects actions with known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that are tracked
in the [GitHub Advisories database]. Examples of commonly disclosed
vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions include [credential disclosure] and code
injection via [template injection].

[GitHub Advisories database]: https://github.com/advisories

[credential disclosure]: #artipacked

[template injection]: #template-injection

### Remediation

If the vulnerability is applicable to your use: upgrade to a fixed version of
the action if one is available, or remove the action's usage entirely.

## `ref-confusion`

| Type     | Examples            | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [ref-confusion.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ                 |

[ref-confusion.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/ref-confusion.yml

Detects actions that are pinned to confusable symbolic refs (i.e. branches
or tags).

Like with [impostor commits], actions that are used with a symbolic ref
in their `uses:` are subject to a degree of ambiguity: a ref like
`@v1` might refer to either a branch or tag ref.

An attacker can exploit this ambiguity to publish a branch or tag ref that
takes precedence over a legitimate one, delivering a malicious action to
pre-existing consumers of that action without having to modify those consumers.

[impostor commits]: #impostor-commit

### Remediation

Switch to hash-pinned actions.

## `self-hosted-runner`

| Type     | Examples            | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [self-hosted.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå                 |

[self-hosted.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/self-hosted.yml

!!! note

    This is a `--pedantic` only audit, due to `zizmor`'s limited ability
    to analyze runner configurations themselves. See #34 for more details.

Detects self-hosted runner usage within workflows.

GitHub supports self-hosted runners, which behave similarly to GitHub-hosted
runners but use client-managed compute resources.

Self-hosted runners are very hard to secure by default, which is why
GitHub does not recommend their use in public repositories.

Other resources:

* [Self-hosted runner security]

### Remediation

In general, self-hosted runners should only be used on private repositories.
Exposing self-hosted runners to potential public use is *always* a security
risk.

In practice, there are many cases (such as custom host configurations) where
a self-hosted runner is needed on a public repository. In these cases,
there are steps you can take to minimize their risk:

1. Require manual approval on workflows for all external contributors.
   This can be configured at repository, workflow, or enterprise-wide
   levels. See [GitHub's docs] for more information.
1. Use only [ephemeral ("just-in-time") runners]. These runners are
   created just-in-time to perform one job and are destroyed immediately
   afterwards, making it harder (but not impossible) for an attacker to
   maintain persistence.

[GitHub's docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/approving-workflow-runs-from-public-forks

[ephemeral ("just-in-time") runners]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-just-in-time-runners

## `template-injection`

| Type     | Examples                 | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [template-injection.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[template-injection.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/template-injection.yml

Detects potential sources of code injection via template expansion.

GitHub Actions allows workflows to define *template expansions*, which
occur within special `${{ ... }}` delimiters. These expansions happen
before workflow and job execution, meaning the expansion
of a given expression appears verbatim in whatever context it was performed in.

Template expansions aren't syntax-aware, meaning that they can result in
unintended shell injection vectors. This is especially true when they're
used with attacker-controllable expression contexts, such as
`github.event.issue.title` (which the attacker can fully control by supplying
a new issue title).

Other resources:

* [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input]

### Remediation

The most common forms of template injection are in `run:` and similar
code-execution blocks. In these cases, an inline template expansion
can typically be replaced by an environment variable whose value comes
from the expanded template.

This avoids the vulnerability, since variable expansion is subject to normal
shell quoting/expansion rules.

!!! tip

    To fully remediate the vulnerability, you **should not** use
    `${{ env.VARNAME }}`, since that is still a template expansion.
    Instead, you should use `${VARNAME}` to ensure that the shell *itself*
    performs the variable expansion.


!!! tip

    When switching to `${VARNAME}`, keep in mind that different shells have
    different environment variable syntaxes. In particular, Powershell (the
    default shell on Windows runners) uses `${env:VARNAME}`.

    To avoid having to specialize your handling for different runners,
    you can set `shell: sh` or `shell: bash`.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml title="template-injection.yml" hl_lines="3"
    - name: Check title
      run: |
        title="${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
        if [[ ! $title =~ ^.*:\ .*$ ]]; then
          echo "Bad issue title"
          exit 1
        fi
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml title="template-injection.yml" hl_lines="3 8-9"
    - name: Check title
      run: |
        title="${ISSUE_TITLE}"
        if [[ ! $title =~ ^.*:\ .*$ ]]; then
          echo "Bad issue title"
          exit 1
        fi
      env:
        ISSUE_TITLE: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
    ```

## `use-trusted-publishing`

| Type     | Examples                     | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [pypi-manual-credential.yml] | v0.1.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[pypi-manual-credential.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/pypi-manual-credential.yml

Detects packaging workflows that could use [Trusted Publishing].

Some packaging ecosystems/indices (like [PyPI] and [RubyGems]) support
"Trusted Publishing," which is an OIDC-based "tokenless" authentication
mechanism for uploading to the index from within a CI/CD workflow.

This "tokenless" flow has significant security benefits over a traditional
manually configured API token, and should be preferred wherever supported
and possible.

[Trusted Publishing]: https://repos.openssf.org/trusted-publishers-for-all-package-repositories.html

[PyPI]: https://pypi.org

[RubyGems]: https://rubygems.org

Other resources:

* [Trusted Publishers for All Package Repositories]
* [Publishing to PyPI with a Trusted Publisher]
* [Trusted Publishing - RubyGems Guides]
* [Trusted publishing: a new benchmark for packaging security]

### Remediation

In general, enabling Trusted Publishing requires a one-time change to your
package's configuration on its associated index (e.g. PyPI or RubyGems).

Once your Trusted Publisher is registered, see @pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish
or @rubygems/release-gem for canonical examples of using it.

## `unpinned-uses`

| Type     | Examples                     | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [unpinned.yml]              | v0.4.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[unpinned.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/unpinned.yml

Detects "unpinned" `uses:` clauses.

When a `uses:` clause is not pinned by branch, tag, or SHA reference,
GitHub Actions will use the latest commit on the referenced repository
(or, in the case of Docker actions, the `:latest` tag).

This can represent a (small) security risk, as it leaves the calling workflow
at the mercy of the callee action's default branch.

When used with `--pedantic`, this audit will also flag pinned-but-unhashed
`uses:`. For example, `actions/checkout@v4` will not be flagged by default,
but would be flagged with `--pedantic`.

### Remediation

For repository actions (like @actions/checkout): add a branch, tag, or SHA
reference.

For Docker actions (like `docker://ubuntu`): add an appropriate
`:{version}` suffix.

A before/after example is shown below.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml title="unpinned-uses.yml" hl_lines="8 12"
    name: unpinned-uses
    on: [push]

    jobs:
    unpinned-uses:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout
          with:
          persist-credentials: false

        - uses: docker://ubuntu
          with:
          entrypoint: /bin/echo
          args: hello!
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml title="unpinned-uses.yml" hl_lines="8 12"
    name: unpinned-uses
    on: [push]

    jobs:
    unpinned-uses:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # (1)!
          with:
          persist-credentials: false

        - uses: docker://ubuntu:24.04
          with:
          entrypoint: /bin/echo
          args: hello!
    ```

    1. Or `actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683` for a SHA-pinned action.


## `insecure-commands`

| Type     | Examples                | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [insecure-commands.yml] | v0.5.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[insecure-commands.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/insecure-commands.yml

Detects opt-in for executing insecure workflow commands.

Workflow commands (like `::set-env` and `::add-path`)
[were deprecated by GitHub] in 2020 due to their inherent weaknesses
(e.g., allowing any command with the ability to emit to `stdout`
to inject environment variables and therefore obtain code execution).

However, users can explicitly re-enable them by setting the
`ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` environment variable at the workflow,
job, or step level.

Other resources:

* [Semgrep audit]

### Remediation

In general, users should use for [GitHub Actions environment files]
(like `GITHUB_PATH` and `GITHUB_OUTPUT`) instead of using workflow commands.

=== "Before"

    ```yaml title="insecure-commands" hl_lines="3"
    - name: Setup my-bin
      run: |
        echo "::add-path::$HOME/.local/my-bin"
      env:
        ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS: true
    ```

=== "After"

    ```yaml title="insecure-commands" hl_lines="3"
    - name: Setup my-bin
      run: |
        echo "$HOME/.local/my-bin" >> "$GITHUB_PATH"
    ```

## `github-env`

| Type     | Examples           | Introduced in | Works offline  | Enabled by default |
|----------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Workflow  | [github-env.yml]   | v0.6.0        | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 |

[github-env.yml]: https://github.com/woodruffw/gha-hazmat/blob/main/.github/workflows/github-env.yml

Detects dangerous usages of the `GITHUB_ENV` environment variable.

When used in workflows with dangerous triggers (such as `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run`),
`GITHUB_ENV` can be an arbitrary code execution risk. In particular, if the attacker is able to set
arbitrary variables or variable contents via `GITHUB_ENV`, they made be able to set `LD_PRELOAD`
or otherwise induce code execution implicitly within subsequent steps.

### Remediation

In general, you should avoid setting `GITHUB_ENV` within workflows that are attacker-triggered,
like `pull_request_target`.

If you need to pass state between steps, consider using `GITHUB_OUTPUT` instead.
