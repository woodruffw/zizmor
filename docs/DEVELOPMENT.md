# Hacking on `zizmor`

## Writing documentation

One of the best ways to help us with `zizmor` is to help us improve our
documentation!

Here are some things we could use help with:

* Improving the detail in our [audit documentation pages](./audit/).
* Improving the detail in our [README](../README.md), e.g. by adding
  or improving our usage examples.

More generally, see [issues labeled with `documentation`] for a potential
list of documentation efforts to contribute on.

## Adding or modifying an audit

These docs could use help.

For now, please run `cargo doc --open` and refer to our internal
documentation!
