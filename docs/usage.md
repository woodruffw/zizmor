# Usage

## Input collection

Before auditing, `zizmor` performs an input collection phase.

There are three input sources that `zizmor` knows about:

1. Individual workflow and composite action files, e.g. `foo.yml` and
   `my-action/action.yml`;
2. "Local" GitHub repositories in the form of a directory, e.g. `my-repo/`;
3. "Remote" GitHub repositories in the form of a "slug", e.g.
   `pypa/sampleproject`.

    !!! tip

        By default, a remote repository will be audited from the `HEAD`
        of the default branch. To control this, you can append a `git`
        reference to the slug:

        ```bash
        # audit at HEAD on the default branch
        zizmor example/example

        # audit at branch or tag `v1`
        zizmor example/example@v1

        # audit at a specific SHA
        zizmor example/example@abababab...
        ```

    !!! tip

        Remote auditing requires Internet access and a GitHub API token.
        See [Operating Modes](#operating-modes) for more information.

`zizmor` can audit multiple inputs in the same run, and different input
sources can be mixed and matched:

```bash
# audit a single local workflow, an entire local repository, and
# a remote repository all in the same run
zizmor ../example.yml ../other-repo/ example/example
```

When auditing local and/or remote repositories, `zizmor` will collect both
workflows (e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) **and** action definitions
(e.g. `custom-action/foo.yml`) by default. To disable one or the other,
you can use the `--collect=...` option.

```bash
# collect everything (the default)
zizmor --collect=all example/example

# collect only workflows
zizmor --collect=workflows-only example/example

# collect only actions
zizmor --collect=actions-only example/example
```

!!! tip

    `--collect=...` only controls input collection from repository input
    sources. In other words, `zizmor --collect=actions-only workflow.yml`
    *will* audit `workflow.yml`, since it was passed explicitly and not
    collected indirectly.

## Operating Modes

Some of `zizmor`'s audits require access to GitHub's API.
`zizmor` will perform online audits by default *if* the user has a `GH_TOKEN`
specified in their environment. If no `GH_TOKEN` is present, then `zizmor`
will operate in offline mode by default.

Both of these can be made explicit through their respective command-line flags:

```bash
# force offline, even if a GH_TOKEN is present
# this disables all online actions, including repository fetches
zizmor --offline workflow.yml

# passing a token explicitly will enable online mode
zizmor --gh-token ghp-... workflow.yml

# online for the purpose of fetching the input (example/example),
# but all audits themselves are offline
zizmor --no-online-audits --gh-token ghp-... example/example
```

## Output formats

`zizmor` always produces output on `stdout`.

By default, `zizmor` produces `cargo`-style diagnostic output. This output
will be colorized by default when sent to a supporting terminal and
uncolorized by default when piped to another program. Users can also explicitly
disable output colorization by setting `NO_COLOR=1` in their environment.

Apart from the default, `zizmor` supports JSON and [SARIF] as machine-readable
output modes. These can be selected via the `--format` option:

Output formats can be controlled explicitly via the `--format` option:

```bash
# use the default diagnostic output explicitly
zizmor --format plain

# emit zizmor's own JSON format
zizmor --format json

# emit SARIF JSON instead of normal JSON
zizmor --format sarif
```

See [Integration](#integration) for suggestions on when to use each format.

## Exit codes

!!! note

    Exit codes 10 and above are **not used** if `--no-exit-codes` or
    `--format sarif` is passed.

`zizmor` uses various exit codes to summarize the results of a run:

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 0    | Successful audit; no findings to report (or SARIF mode enabled). |
| 1    | Error during audit; consult output. |
| 10   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "unknown" level. |
| 11   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "informational" level. |
| 12   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "low" level. |
| 13   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "medium" level. |
| 14   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "high" level. |

All other exit codes are currently reserved.

## Using personas

!!! tip

    `--persona=...` is available in `v0.7.0` and later.

`zizmor` comes with three pre-defined "personas," which dictate how
sensitive `zizmor`'s analyses are:

* The _regular persona_: the user wants high-signal, low-noise, actionable
  security findings. This persona is best for ordinary local use as well as use
  in most CI/CD setups, which is why it's the default.

    !!! note

        This persona can be made explicit with `--persona=regular`,
        although this is not required.


* The _pedantic persona_, enabled by `--persona=pedantic`: the user wants
  *code smells* in addition to regular, actionable security findings.

    This persona is ideal for finding things that are a good idea
    to clean up or resolve, but are likely not immediately actionable
    security findings (or are actionable, but suggest a intentional
    security decision by the workflow/action author).

    For example, using the pedantic persona will flag the following
    with an `unpinned-uses` finding, since it uses a symbolic reference
    as its pin instead of a hashed pin:

    ```yaml
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
    ```

    produces:

    ```console
    $ zizmor --pedantic tests/test-data/unpinned-uses.yml
    help[unpinned-uses]: unpinned action reference
      --> tests/test-data/unpinned-uses.yml:14:9
       |
    14 |       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       |         ------------------------- help: action is not pinned to a hash ref
       |
       = note: audit confidence â†’ High
    ```

    !!! tip

        This persona can also be enabled with `--pedantic`, which is
        an alias for `--persona=pedantic`.

* The _auditor persona_, enabled by `--persona=auditor`: the user wants
  *everything* flagged by `zizmor`, including findings that are likely
  to be false positives.

    This persona is ideal for security auditors and code reviewers, who
    want to go through `zizmor`'s findings manually with a fine-toothed comb.

    Some audits, notably `self-hosted-runner`, *only* produce auditor-level
    results. This is because these audits require runtime context that `zizmor`
    lacks access to by design, meaning that their results are always
    subject to false positives.

    For example, with the default persona:

    ```console
    $ zizmor tests/test-data/self-hosted.yml
    ðŸŒˆ completed self-hosted.yml
    No findings to report. Good job! (1 suppressed)
    ```

    and with `--persona=auditor`:

    ```console
    $ zizmor --persona=auditor tests/test-data/self-hosted.yml
    note[self-hosted-runner]: runs on a self-hosted runner
      --> tests/test-data/self-hosted.yml:8:5
        |
      8 |     runs-on: [self-hosted, my-ubuntu-box]
        |     ------------------------------------- note: self-hosted runner used here
        |
        = note: audit confidence â†’ High

      1 finding: 1 unknown, 0 informational, 0 low, 0 medium, 0 high
    ```

## Filtering results

There are two straightforward ways to filter `zizmor`'s results:

1. If all you need is severity or confidence filtering (e.g. "I want only
   medium-severity and/or medium-confidence and above results"), then you can use
   the `--min-severity` and `--min-confidence` flags:

    !!! tip

        `--min-severity` and `--min-confidence` are available in `v0.6.0` and later.

     ```bash
     # filter unknown, informational, and low findings with unknown, low confidence
     zizmor --min-severity=medium --min-confidence=medium ...
     ```

2. If you need more advanced filtering (with nontrivial conditions or
   state considerations), then consider using `--format=json` and using
   `jq` (or a script) to perform your filtering.

     As a starting point, here's how you can use `jq` to filter `zizmor`'s
     JSON output to only results that are marked as "high confidence":

     ```bash
     zizmor --format=json ... | jq 'map(select(.determinations.confidence == "High"))'
     ```

## Ignoring results

`zizmor`'s defaults are not always 100% right for every possible use case.

If you find that `zizmor` produces findings that aren't right for you
(and **aren't** false positives, which should be reported!), then you can
choose to *selectively ignore* results via either special ignore comments
*or* a `zizmor.yml` configuration file.

### With comments

!!! note

    Ignore comment support was added in `v0.6.0`.

Findings can be ignored inline with `# zizmor: ignore[rulename]` comments.
This is ideal for one-off ignores, where a whole `zizmor.yml` configuration
file would be too heavyweight.

Multiple different audits can be ignored with a single comment by
separating each rule with a comma, e.g.
`# zizmor: ignore[artipacked,ref-confusion]`.

These comments can be placed anywhere in any span identified by a finding.

For example, to ignore a single `artipacked` finding:

```yaml title="example.yml"
uses: actions/checkout@v3 # zizmor: ignore[artipacked]
```

### With `zizmor.yml`

When ignoring multiple findings (or entire files), a `zizmor.yml` configuration
file is easier to maintain than one-off comments.

Here's what a `zizmor.yml` file might look like:

```yaml title="zizmor.yml"
rules:
  template-injection:
    ignore:
      - safe.yml
      - somewhat-safe.yml:123
      - one-exact-spot.yml:123:456
```

Concretely, this `zizmor.yml` configuration declares three ignore rules,
all for the [`template-injection`](./audits.md#template-injection) audit:

1. Ignore all findings in `safe.yml`, regardless of line/column location
2. Ignore *any* findings in `somewhat-safe.yml` that occur on line 123
3. Ignore *one* finding in `one-exact-spot.yml` that occurs on line 123, column 456

More generally, the filename ignore syntax is `workflow.yml:line:col`, where
`line` and `col` are both optional and 1-based (meaning `foo.yml:1:1`
is the start of the file, not `foo.yml:0:0`).

To pass a configuration to `zizmor`, you can either place `zizmor.yml`
somewhere where `zizmor` [will discover it], or pass it explicitly via
the `--config` argument. With `--config`, the file can be named anything:

```bash
zizmor --config my-zizmor-config.yml /dir/to/audit
```

[will discover it]: ./configuration.md#precedence

See [Configuration: `rules.<id>.ignore`](./configuration.md#rulesidignore) for
more details on writing ignore rules.

## Caching between runs

!!! tip

    Persistent caching (between runs of `zizmor`) is available in `v0.10.0` and later.

!!! warning

    Caches can contain sensitive metadata, especially when auditing private
    repositories! Think twice before sharing your cache or reusing
    it across machine/visibility boundaries.

`zizmor` caches HTTP responses from GitHub's REST APIs to speed up individual
audits. This HTTP cache is persisted and re-used between runs as well.

By default `zizmor` will cache to an appropriate user-level caching directory:

* Linux and macOS: `$XDG_CACHE_DIR` (`~/.cache/zizmor` by default)
* Windows: `~\AppData\Roaming\woodruffw\zizmor`.

To override the default caching directory, pass `--cache-dir`:

```bash
# cache in /tmp instead
zizmor --cache-dir /tmp/zizmor ...
```

## Integration

### Use in GitHub Actions

`zizmor` is designed to integrate with GitHub Actions. In particular,
`zizmor --format sarif` specifies [SARIF] as the output format, which GitHub's
code scanning feature uses.

You can integrate `zizmor` into your CI/CD however you please, but one
easy way to do it is with a workflow that connects to
[GitHub's code scanning functionality].

!!! important

    The workflow below performs a [SARIF] upload, which is available for public
    repositories and for GitHub Enterprise Cloud organizations that have
    [Advanced Security]. If neither of these apply to you, then you can
    adapt the workflow to emit JSON or diagnostic output via `--format json`
    or `--format plain` respectively.

```yaml title="zizmor.yml"
name: GitHub Actions Security Analysis with zizmor ðŸŒˆ

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]

jobs:
  zizmor:
    name: zizmor latest via PyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      # required for workflows in private repositories
      contents: read
      actions: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Install the latest version of uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

      - name: Run zizmor ðŸŒˆ
        run: uvx zizmor --format sarif . > results.sarif # (2)!
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # (1)!

      - name: Upload SARIF file
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: results.sarif
          category: zizmor
```

1. Optional: Remove the `env:` block to only run `zizmor`'s offline audits.

2. This installs the [zizmor package from PyPI], since it's pre-compiled
   and therefore completes much faster. You could instead compile `zizmor`
   within CI/CD with `cargo install zizmor`.

For more inspiration, see `zizmor`'s own [repository workflow scan], as well
as GitHub's example of [running ESLint] as a security workflow.

### Use with GitHub Enterprise

`zizmor` supports GitHub instances other than `github.com`.

To use it with your [GitHub Enterprise] instance (either cloud or self-hosted),
pass your instance's domain with `--gh-hostname` or `GH_HOST`:

```bash
zizmor --gh-hostname custom.example.com ...

# or, with GH_HOST
GH_HOST=custom.ghe.com zizmor ...
```

[GitHub Enterprise]: https://github.com/enterprise

### Use with `pre-commit`

`zizmor` can be used with the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.
To do so, add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` `repos` section:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor-pre-commit
  rev: v1.2.2 # (1)!
  hooks:
  - id: zizmor
```

1. Don't forget to update this version to the latest `zizmor` release!

This will run `zizmor` on every commit.

!!! tip

    If you want to run `zizmor` only on specific files, you can use the
    `files` option. This setting is *optional*, as `zizmor` will
    scan the entire repository by default.

    See [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) documentation for more
    information on how to configure `pre-commit`.

## Limitations

`zizmor` can help you write more secure GitHub workflow and action definitions,
as well as help you find exploitable bugs in existing definitions.

However, like all tools, `zizmor` is **not a panacea**, and has
fundamental limitations that must be kept in mind. This page
documents some of those limitations.

### `zizmor` is a _static_ analysis tool

`zizmor` is a _static_ analysis tool. It never executes any code, nor does it
have access to any runtime state.

In contrast, GitHub Actions workflow and action definitions are highly
dynamic, and can be influenced by inputs that can only be inspected at
runtime.

For example, here is a workflow where a job's matrix is generated
at runtime by a previous job, making the matrix impossible to
analyze statically:

```yaml
build-matrix:
  name: Build the matrix
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    matrix: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
  steps:
    - id: set-matrix
      run: |
        echo "matrix=$(python generate_matrix.py)" >> "${GITHUB_OUTPUT}"

run:
  name: ${{ matrix.name }}
  needs:
    - build-matrix
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.build-matrix.outputs.matrix) }}
  steps:
    - run: |
        echo "hello ${{ matrix.something }}"
```

In the above, the expansion of `${{ matrix.something }}` is entirely controlled
by the output of `generate_matrix.py`, which is only known at runtime.

In such cases, `zizmor` will err on the side of verbosity. For example,
the [template-injection](./audits.md#template-injection) audit will flag
`${{ matrix.something }}` as a potential code injection risk, since it
can't infer anything about what `matrix.something` might expand to.

### `zizmor` audits workflow and action _definitions_ only

`zizmor` audits workflow and action _definitions_ only. That means the
contents of `foo.yml` (for your workflow definitions) or `action.yml` (for your
composite action definitions).

In practice, this means that `zizmor` does **not** analyze other files
referenced by workflow and action definitions. For example:

```yaml
example:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: step-1
      run: |
        echo foo=$(bar) >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: step-2
      run: |
        # some-script.sh contains the same code as step-1
        ./some-script.sh
```

`zizmor` can analyze `step-1` above, because the code it executes
is present within the workflow definition itself. It *cannot* analyze
`step-2` beyond the presence of a script execution, since it doesn't
audit shell scripts or any other kind of files.

More generally, `zizmor` cannot analyze files indirectly referenced within
workflow/action definitions, as they may not actually exist until runtime.
For example, `some-script.sh` above may have been generated or downloaded
outside of any repository-tracked state.
